# A-tutorial-on-how-to-farm-facebook-accounts
**registration creation**

Registration can be done in several ways:
1. From Nox or other emulator (medium-high quality)
2. Directly from antidetect (low-medium quality)
3. From a cell phone (high)

>The way you will register depends on the number of accounts that will go to the check, when working with antidetect in my case about 75% of accounts went to ban forever, it is very much for manual labor.

**For the job, we need:**

1. Mobile proxies (ideal for fb, you can in principle and rubber).
2. Computer or laptop or phone
3. table (in it we enter data, the date when the account was registered, login, password, aidi account)
4. SMS activator (look where the best prices for your purposes and use any)

>At this stage, I give accounts otlega, the more otlega the more expensive is an acke. Under the farm take an account with a month of otlega and already on 1-3 days there is advertising, which is very good for farming and will be a lot of satisfied customers.

**Creating accounts from the emulator:**

1. Go to Nox, long press on wifi, change network-extended settings-proxy server-manually-insert ipi in hostname, insert port-insert port-save. Go to the browser and we will be asked to specify login and password, we specify login and password from the proxy. In nox you can connect proxy with http protocol, sox5 is not supported.

If you use your mobile internet, you don't need to change anything. The quality of registration is better when you work with a purchased proxy, but for the first time your own proxy will do.

2. Buy a number on the sms activator

3. Go in and register an account on the number, add 1 photo, fill out the profile, take a link to the profile, you can immediately confirm accounts by mail, take autoregister any adequate mail.

4. The account is ready!

**Create an account with an anti-detect browser:**

1. I use the dolphin for 10 profiles
2. Start proxy in antidetect
3. Go to a site where you can log in using Facebook (don't use popular sites, more bans)
4. Further everything is the same as noxa

**Create an account from your phone:**

1. If you use your internet or distribution, go to Facebook Lite, take the number and register your account
2. After registration, clean the data in the settings of the application and enable air mode to change ipi.
3. Always take aidi account or link to the account to check the account before selling in the checker https://checker.fb.rip/.

>To sell an account you need to specify login-password-toke-EAAB if you registered with antidetect, user agent and cookies.

**PROCESS PHARMA**

Here is not a big manual from my friend, in this case, he works on the call zrd, such accounts are more expensive, personally I did not register so, I make accounts for their own farming. If you Facebook massively banned means you show too much activity.

Day 1
1. Launching the browser

2. Fb registration with a female name
-Specify phone number, confirm it
If it says: “we will check your data...” - you need to change the proxy and start again.
-Fill in information (position, where she studied, where she lives, hobbies).

3. Actions in the account
-5-6 posts, photos, publish messages)
-join dating groups 10+
-scroll through the feed, find posts with lots of comments and write (looking for dating/boyfriend)
-Only accept as a friend, do not throw requests yourself (affects the trustworthiness of the account)

1. Add normal people (under your geo) no more than 30 people
